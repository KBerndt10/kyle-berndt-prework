                    I am from Savage, MN. I attended the Twin Cities University of Minnesota's Twin City campus to earn
                    a bachelor's degree in computer science. During high school
                    I spent the summers as a voluntyeer counselor at a boys camp caled Camp Nathanael in Hinckley, MN.
                    During that time I taught various skills including, archery,
                    model rocketry, and geocaching. During the summer of 2018 I had the opportunity to work at Wings
                    Financial Credit Union as a web developer intern. My big accomplishment during the summer was
                    to create a significant portion of their online loan application form.

                    One of my most unique hobbies is aquarium keeping. I currently keep about 250 gallons of freshwater
                    aquariums which contain over 60 fish, 7 varieties of
                    plants, and numerous snails. I also have a 75 gallon reef aquarium, which has snails, hermit crabs,
                    and about 25 types of coral. My favorite species of fish is
                    the stripe-tailed eartheater cichlid (Geophagus Winemilleri).

                    I also enjoy playing both physical and digital games. I play most of my video games on Xbox. I enjoy
                    a broad spectrum of video games, but some of my favorites would
                    probably the Gears of War series, Terraria, and the Mount and Blade series. I enjoy playing a
                    variety of physical games as well, and I even worked as a seasonal sales
                    representative at Games By James in 2014. I am currently the game master for a Fantasycraft
                    campaign, which is an RPG game similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
