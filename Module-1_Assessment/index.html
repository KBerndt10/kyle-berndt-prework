                            I am from Savage, MN. I attended the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities Campus where I
                            earned a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Software Engineering.
                            During high school, I spent summers volunteering as a counselor at Camp Nathanael in
                            Hinckley, MN. During that time, I taught various skills including, archery, model rocketry,
                            and geocaching. The summer of 2018 I worked at Wings Financial Credit Union as a web
                            developer intern. My biggest accomplishment during my internship was creating a significant
                            portion of their online loan application form.

                            One of my most unique hobbies is keeping aquariums. I currently keep approximately 250
                            gallons of freshwater aquariums which contain over 60 fish, 7 varieties of plants, and
                            numerous snails. I have a 75 gallon saltwater reef aquarium, which has snails, hermit crabs,
                            and about 25 types of coral. My favorite species of fish is the stripe-tailed eartheater
                            cichlid (Geophagus Winemilleri).
                        </p>

                            I also enjoy playing both physical and digital games. I play most of my video games on Xbox.
                            I enjoy a broad spectrum of video games, but some of my favorites would probably the Gears
                            of War series, Terraria, and the Mount and Blade series. I enjoy playing a variety of
                            physical games as well, and I even worked as a seasonal sales representative at Games By
                            James in 2014. I am currently the game master for a Fantasycraft campaign, which is an RPG
                            game similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
