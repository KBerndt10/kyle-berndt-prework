###### [Activity 2](./JavaScript_Basics_Assessment/activity-2.js)
This project creates a prompt requesting the user's name. Then it displays an alert notifying them of whether their name is at least 4 characters or fewer than 4 characters.

###### [Activity 3](./JavaScript_Basics_Assessment/activity-3.js)
This program has an array of 3 student names, and requests the user for 3 more. It will then write all 6 names to the console.

#### [Module 2 Assessment](./Module-2_Assessment)
This project is a Lord of the Rings themed Hangman game website. The user will attempt to guess a mystery word on this site. The user will initially see the word as '\_'s instead of letters. When the user hits a key, it will either replace '\_'s with the corresponding letter if that letter is part of the word to be quessed. Otherwise their number of remaining guesses will decrement and the letter will be added to the already guessed section. 

If the user uses up all of their guesses, an audio snippet will play and they will have to try again with a different word. If the user successfully guesses the word before runnning out of guesses, an audio snippet will play, they will gain a win, an image related to the guessed topic will appear, and they will move on to a new round. To see the site in action, download the project and open [index.html](./Module-2_Assessment/index.html) in Google Chrome.
